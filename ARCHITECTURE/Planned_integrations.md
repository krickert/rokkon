# Rokkon Engine: Planned Integrations

The Rokkon Engine is designed as a flexible and extensible platform. Its true power will be realized through a rich ecosystem of connectors, pipeline steps, and sinks that allow it to interact with various data sources, perform diverse processing tasks, and deliver results to numerous destinations. This document outlines the planned integrations that will expand Rokkon's capabilities.

The ability to rapidly develop and integrate these new modules stems from Rokkon's core architecture:
*   **gRPC-based Microservices:** Any language supporting gRPC can be used to write a module.
*   **Clear Contracts (`rokkon-protobuf`):** Standardized interfaces for module interaction.
*   **Dynamic Configuration & Discovery (Consul):** Easy integration of new modules into pipelines.

This means development teams can work in parallel, leveraging existing libraries and domain expertise to build new integrations quickly.

## Planned Connectors (Data Sources)

Connectors are specialized modules responsible for ingesting data from external systems into Rokkon pipelines.

## Why This Can Happen Quickly

The development and integration of these modules can be accelerated due to several factors inherent in Rokkon's design and the broader software ecosystem:

*   **Microservice Architecture:** Each module is a small, focused service. Teams can develop them independently and in parallel.
*   **gRPC & Protobuf:** Clear, language-agnostic contracts simplify integration. Code generation for client/server stubs saves significant time.
*   **Leveraging Existing Libraries & SDKs:** For most planned integrations, mature open-source libraries, cloud provider SDKs, or commercial SDKs already exist. Module development often becomes a task of wrapping these existing tools within Rokkon's gRPC interface.
*   **Language Flexibility:** Teams can use the language best suited for the task or where existing expertise lies (e.g., Python for AI/NLP, Java for robust enterprise connectors, Go for high-performance network utilities).
*   **Modularity of Rokkon Engine:** The engine itself doesn't need to change significantly to support new modules, as long as they adhere to the defined gRPC contracts and registration process.
*   **Community Contributions (Future):** A well-defined module SDK and clear documentation can encourage community contributions for new connectors, steps, and sinks.
*   **Quarkus for Java Modules:** If Java is chosen, Quarkus significantly speeds up development with features like live coding, simplified configuration, and easy native compilation.

This combination of a solid architectural foundation and the ability to leverage existing technologies allows the Rokkon Engine to rapidly expand its ecosystem of integrations.
