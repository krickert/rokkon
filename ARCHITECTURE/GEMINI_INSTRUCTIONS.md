Based on the comprehensive architecture documents and our detailed discussion, here is a full summary of the multi-layered testing strategy for the Rokkon Engine. This framework is designed to address the challenges of a complex, distributed system by providing fast feedback during development while ensuring robust, comprehensive validation for releases.

### Guiding Principles

The core of this strategy is to separate tests into distinct layers, each with a specific purpose, scope, and set of tools. This addresses the previous issues of conflated, slow, and flaky tests by enforcing isolation where appropriate and using dedicated environments for true integration.

* **Fast Feedback:** Developers should spend most of their time running fast, isolated tests that don't rely on external infrastructure. This is the purpose of Unit and Component tests, which are optimized for Quarkus Dev Mode.
* **Reliable Integration:** Interactions with external systems like Consul and Kafka are critical and prone to error. Integration tests use real, ephemeral instances of these services (via Testcontainers) to validate this "glue code" reliably.
* **Full System Confidence:** End-to-end tests provide the ultimate confidence by verifying complete user workflows across the entire deployed system, just as it would run in production.

### 1\. Unit Tests (Isolate and Verify Logic)

* **Goal:** To verify the correctness of a single class or method (a "unit") in complete isolation from the framework and external systems.
* **Scope:** Focus on business logic, algorithms, data transformations, and state changes within a class.
* **What to Test:** Utility classes, validator logic (`engine-validators`), specific data model transformations, and individual service methods with their dependencies mocked.
* **Key Guidelines:**
    * **Strict Isolation:** These tests **must not** start the Quarkus application context. They must not access the network, filesystem, or any external processes.
    * **Mock Everything:** All external dependencies are replaced with "mocks" or "stubs." This includes `ConsulClient`, `KafkaProducer`, gRPC clients, and any other injected CDI beans.
    * **Speed is Paramount:** Unit tests should execute in milliseconds.
* **Tools:** JUnit 5, Mockito (for mocking Java dependencies).

**Example: Testing a Simple Validator**

```java
// In engine-validators/src/test/java/com/rokkon/validators/PipelineConfigValidatorTest.java

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import com.rokkon.models.PipelineConfig; // Assuming this model exists

class PipelineConfigValidatorTest {

    private final PipelineConfigValidator validator = new PipelineConfigValidator();

    @Test
    void whenPipelineNameIsMissing_validationShouldFail() {
        // Arrange
        PipelineConfig config = new PipelineConfig();
        config.setPipelineId(null); // Invalid state
        config.setSteps(...);

        // Act & Assert
        assertFalse(validator.isValid(config), "Validation should fail for null pipeline ID");
    }

    @Test
    void whenPipelineHasNoSteps_validationShouldFail() {
        // Arrange
        PipelineConfig config = new PipelineConfig();
        config.setPipelineId("my-pipeline");
        config.setSteps(Collections.emptyList()); // Invalid state

        // Act & Assert
        assertFalse(validator.isValid(config), "Validation should fail for pipeline with no steps");
    }
}
```

### 2\. Component Tests (Verify Service in a Mocked Context)

* **Goal:** To test a component (e.g., a JAX-RS resource, a gRPC service, or a CDI bean) within a running Quarkus application context, but with its external dependencies (like Consul or other modules) mocked.
* **Scope:** This tests the component's interaction with the Quarkus framework (CDI, REST endpoints) without the slowness and flakiness of real network calls to external systems.
* **What to Test:** REST API endpoints, gRPC service implementations, and any CDI beans that orchestrate logic while depending on external clients.
* **Key Guidelines:**
    * Use `@QuarkusTest` to start a fully-functional, in-memory version of your application.
    * Use `@InjectMock` to replace real external clients with mocks. You can then define the mock's behavior (e.g., `when(consulClient.register(any())).thenReturn(true);`).
    * These are considered "fast tests" and should run as part of the `quarkusDev` continuous testing feedback loop.
* **Tools:** `@QuarkusTest`, `@InjectMock`, Mockito, REST Assured (for testing REST endpoints).

**Example: Testing the PipelineControlService REST Endpoint**

```java
// In rokkon-engine/src/test/java/com/rokkon/engine/api/PipelineControlResourceTest.java

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import io.quarkus.test.junit.mockito.InjectMock;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
import static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.anyString;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.when;
import com.rokkon.engine.PipelineManager; // The service our REST resource uses

@QuarkusTest
public class PipelineControlResourceTest {

    @InjectMock
    PipelineManager pipelineManager; // Inject a mock of the underlying service

    @Test
    public void testDeployPipelineEndpoint() {
        // Arrange: Define the mock's behavior
        when(pipelineManager.deploy(anyString())).thenReturn(true);

        // Act & Assert: Use REST Assured to call the real endpoint
        given()
          .pathParam("pipelineId", "my-test-pipeline")
          .when().post("/api/v1/pipelines/{pipelineId}/deploy")
          .then()
             .statusCode(200); // Verify the HTTP response
    }

    @Test
    public void testDeployNonExistentPipelineEndpoint() {
        // Arrange
        when(pipelineManager.deploy("unknown-pipeline")).thenReturn(false);

        // Act & Assert
        given()
          .pathParam("pipelineId", "unknown-pipeline")
          .when().post("/api/v1/pipelines/{pipelineId}/deploy")
          .then()
             .statusCode(404); // Or whatever failure status is appropriate
    }
}
```

-----

### 3\. Testing in Dev Mode (`quarkusDev`)

* **Goal:** To provide a highly productive, rapid-iteration development environment for developers working on the Rokkon Engine and its modules.
* **Scope:** Focus on live coding of the application logic, with immediate feedback from hot-reloading and the automatic execution of fast Unit and Component tests.
* **Workflow:**
    1.  **Start Dependencies:** Run essential external services like Consul and Kafka in the background using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d consul kafka`. These services are now available on `localhost`.
    2.  **Start Dev Mode:** Run the Rokkon Engine in dev mode: `./gradlew :rokkon-engine:quarkusDev`.
    3.  **Code and Test:** As you make changes to the engine's source code, Quarkus automatically hot-reloads the application. In parallel, it re-runs all associated Unit and Component tests, giving you instant feedback on whether your changes broke existing functionality.
* **Key Guidelines:**
    * This setup is for developing the engine's *internal logic*, not for testing full data flow through external modules.
    * Communication from the host (running `quarkusDev`) to Docker (Consul/Kafka) is straightforward via `localhost` port mappings.
    * Communication from Docker (e.g., a running module trying to register) to the host requires using the special DNS name `host.docker.internal` (for Docker Desktop) or the host's bridge IP as the `ENGINE_HOST`.
    * This is a developer productivity loop, not a full system integration test.

-----

### 4\. Integration Test of a Component

* **Goal:** To verify a component's interaction with *real, live dependencies* (like Consul or Kafka) in an isolated, controlled, and reproducible environment.
* **Scope:** This is where you test the "glue code" that was mocked in component tests. For example, does your module registration code write the correct key-value structure into a *real* Consul instance?
* **What to Test:** Service registration, dynamic configuration loading from Consul, producing/consuming messages with Kafka, and sink modules writing to a database.
* **Key Guidelines:**
    * Use `@QuarkusIntegrationTest` which packages the application and runs it as a JAR, closely mimicking production.
    * Use **Testcontainers** to programmatically start and stop Docker containers for your dependencies (e.g., Consul, Kafka, OpenSearch) for each test or test suite. This guarantees a clean, isolated environment for every run.
    * Place these tests in a separate Gradle source set, typically `src/integrationTest/java`, to keep them separate from fast unit/component tests.
    * Because these tests involve container startup and real network I/O, they are slower and are typically run by CI/CD pipelines or manually before committing code.
* **Tools:** `@QuarkusIntegrationTest`, Testcontainers, Awaitility (for handling asynchronous operations).

**Example: Testing Real Module Registration with Consul**

```java
// In rokkon-engine/src/integrationTest/java/com/rokkon/engine/registration/ModuleRegistrationIntegrationTest.java
import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusIntegrationTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;
import org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Testcontainers;
import com.orbitz.consul.Consul;
import com.orbitz.consul.model.agent.Service;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

@Testcontainers
@QuarkusIntegrationTest
public class ModuleRegistrationIntegrationTest {

    // Testcontainers will start a Consul container for this test
    @Container
    public static GenericContainer<?> consulContainer = new GenericContainer<>("consul:latest")
            .withExposedPorts(8500);

    // This configures the running Quarkus app to use the dynamic port of our test container
    static {
        System.setProperty("quarkus.consul-config.host", "localhost");
        System.setProperty("quarkus.consul-config.port", String.valueOf(consulContainer.getMappedPort(8500)));
    }

    @Test
    void testRegisterModuleFlow() {
        // Arrange: Create a client to talk to the Rokkon Engine and Consul
        // The gRPC client would call the real ModuleRegistrationService on the running app
        // For simplicity, let's assume registration is triggered and we verify the result in Consul
        String serviceName = "test-parser-module";
        String serviceId = "test-parser-module-instance-1";

        // ACT: (This part would be replaced with a real gRPC call to the engine)
        // registerModule(serviceName, serviceId, "1.2.3", "10.0.0.5", 9090);

        // ASSERT: Verify the service was actually created in the real Consul container
        Consul consulClient = Consul.builder()
            .withHostAndPort("localhost", consulContainer.getMappedPort(8500))
            .build();

        // Use Awaitility for async operations
        await().atMost(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS).until(() ->
            consulClient.agentClient().getServices().containsKey(serviceId)
        );

        Service registeredService = consulClient.agentClient().getServices().get(serviceId);
        assertNotNull(registeredService);
        assertEquals(serviceName, registeredService.getService());
        assertTrue(registeredService.getTags().contains("version:1.2.3"));
    }
}
```

### 5\. Full End-to-End (E2E) Testing

* **Goal:** To validate an entire business workflow across the complete, deployed system, from user input to final output.
* **Scope:** Simulates real-world usage. For Rokkon, a typical E2E test would involve deploying a full pipeline, pushing data into a connector, and verifying that the correctly transformed data appears in a sink.
* **What to Test:** The "A/B Testing" scenario from the architecture docs is a perfect E2E test case. Other examples include testing the Claim Check pattern for large messages or verifying role-based access control from the UI.
* **Workflow:**
    1.  **Environment Setup:** Deploy all required services (Rokkon Engine, multiple modules, Consul, Kafka, OpenSearch sinks, etc.) using Docker Compose or a Kubernetes manifest. This creates a fully networked environment.
    2.  **Test Execution:** Use an external test driver (e.g., a separate Java/Python test script) to interact with the system purely through its public APIs (REST, gRPC).
    3.  **Example Steps:**
        * Use a REST client to send a `PipelineConfig` to the Rokkon Engine's API.
        * Call the `deploy` endpoint.
        * Push a sample document to the pipeline's connector module via its gRPC endpoint.
        * Poll the final OpenSearch sink until the processed document appears.
        * Query the OpenSearch index and assert that the document was chunked, embedded, and indexed as expected.
* **Key Guidelines:**
    * These tests are "black-box"—they know nothing about the internal implementation, only the public interfaces.
    * E2E tests are the most valuable for ensuring all parts of the system work together correctly.
    * They are the slowest and most complex to maintain. They should be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline before a release to production.
    * This layer is where you can later add performance, load, and stress testing.

Rokkon Engine: Architecture Overview


High-Level Overview


The Rokkon Engine is a powerful and flexible data processing pipeline designed for building complex, scalable, and language-agnostic data workflows. It empowers developers to create pipeline steps, connectors (sources of data), and sinks (destinations for data) using any programming language that supports gRPC.


At its core, Rokkon is built around the concept of distributed, interconnected modules that communicate via gRPC and can leverage Kafka for asynchronous data transfer between steps. This architecture allows for:


* Language Agnosticism: Modules can be written in Python, Java, Go, Node.js, C++, Rust, or any other gRPC-supported language. This enables teams to use the best language for a specific task or leverage existing libraries and expertise.
* Scalability: Each pipeline step (module) can be independently scaled. The engine supports fan-in/fan-out patterns, allowing multiple instances of a module to process data in parallel or for data to be distributed across different subsequent steps.
* Flexibility: Pipelines are dynamically configurable and can be modified without recompiling the core engine.
* Resilience: The system is designed for fault tolerance, with features like health checks, service discovery, and configurable retry mechanisms.

Fan-in/Fan-out Capabilities

Each step in a Rokkon pipeline can exhibit fan-in or fan-out behavior:


* Fan-out: A single pipeline step can send its output to multiple subsequent steps. This is useful for tasks like:
  * Processing the same data in different ways simultaneously (e.g., generating different types of embeddings).
  * Distributing data to different sinks for A/B testing or varied storage needs.
  * Triggering multiple independent downstream workflows.
* Fan-in: Multiple pipeline steps can send their output to a single subsequent step. This is useful for:
  * Aggregating results from parallel processing tasks.
  * Combining data from multiple sources before further processing.

Communication between steps can occur synchronously via gRPC or asynchronously via Kafka:


* gRPC: For low-latency, direct communication between steps, especially suitable for request/response patterns or when immediate processing is required.
* Kafka: For decoupling steps, enabling durable messaging, and supporting high-throughput scenarios. Kafka acts as a buffer and allows steps to consume data at their own pace.

Role of Consul

Consul plays a critical role in the Rokkon Engine ecosystem:


1. Service Discovery: Each pipeline module (connector, step, sink) registers itself with Consul upon startup. The Rokkon Engine and other modules use Consul to discover the network location (IP address and port) of available services. This allows for dynamic scaling and resilience, as new instances are automatically discovered and failing instances are removed.
2. Health Checking: Consul performs health checks on registered modules. The engine uses this health information to route data only to healthy instances, improving the overall reliability of the pipelines.
3. Distributed Key-Value (KV) Store: Rokkon Engine stores pipeline definitions, module configurations, and other dynamic operational data in the Consul KV store. This provides a centralized and consistent way to manage configurations, which can be updated dynamically without restarting the engine or modules. The engine watches for changes in Consul and adapts pipeline behavior accordingly.

Example Scenario: Building a Document Processing and Analysis Pipeline


Let's consider a realistic scenario where we want to ingest documents from the Gutenberg Library and Wikipedia, process them, generate embeddings, and store them in multiple OpenSearch instances for A/B testing search relevance.

Pipeline Definition:


1. Initial Steps (Connectors - Fan-in to Parser):
  * Gutenberg Library Connector: A module (e.g., written in Python using requests and BeautifulSoup) that fetches e-books from Project Gutenberg.
  * Wikipedia Connector: A module (e.g., written in Go using Wikipedia's API client) that fetches articles from Wikipedia.
  * Both connectors output raw document content (text, HTML, etc.).


2. `Parser` Step:
  * Receives raw content from both connectors.
  * Cleans HTML, extracts plain text, and normalizes the content.
  * Outputs structured document data (e.g., title, body, source URL).


3. `Chunker` Step:
  * Receives structured documents from the Parser.
  * Splits large documents into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., paragraphs or fixed-size token blocks). This is crucial for effective embedding generation.
  * Outputs individual document chunks.


4. `Chunker 2` Step (Illustrating Fan-out/Fan-in for specialized processing):
  * This could be a specialized chunker that operates on the output of the first Chunker. For example, it might further subdivide chunks based on semantic boundaries or prepare chunks specifically for a different embedding model.
  * Alternatively, Chunker and Chunker 2 could run in parallel, processing different aspects or using different strategies on the output of Parser. For this example, let's assume Chunker 2 refines the output of Chunker 1.


5. `Embedder` Step:
  * Receives document chunks from Chunker 2.
  * Uses a sentence transformer model (e.g., Sentence-BERT, loaded in a Python module) to generate vector embeddings for each chunk.
  * Outputs chunks enriched with their vector embeddings.


6. `Embedder 2` Step (Illustrating Fan-out for multiple embedding types):
  * This step runs in parallel with the Embedder step, receiving the same chunks from Chunker 2.
  * It uses a different embedding model (e.g., a multilingual model or a domain-specific model) to generate a second set of vector embeddings for each chunk.
  * Why this results in 4 vectors (conceptually): If each embedder produces a primary vector and perhaps a title vector (or some other contextual vector), then having two embedders means each chunk is now associated with:
    1. Vector from Embedder 1 (e.g., general purpose)
    2. Contextual vector from Embedder 1 (if applicable)
    3. Vector from Embedder 2 (e.g., multilingual)
    4. Contextual vector from Embedder 2 (if applicable)
  * More simply, if each embedder generates one vector per chunk, the chunk now has two distinct vector representations. If "4 vectors" implies a dimensionality (e.g., two 2D vectors), that's also possible. For this example, we'll assume each embedder generates one vector, so a chunk has two vector representations. The "4 vectors" could refer to a scenario where a pipeline might split the data further, or
    if each embedder itself produced multiple distinct embedding types for a single input. For clarity, let's say each chunk now has two different vector embeddings.


7. Final Steps (Sinks - Fan-out from Embedders):
  * The outputs from Embedder (containing embedding set 1) and Embedder 2 (containing embedding set 2) are fanned out.
  * OpenSearch Sink: A module (e.g., written in Java using the OpenSearch client) that takes the enriched chunks (with embedding set 1) and indexes them into an OpenSearch cluster.
  * OpenSearch Sink 2: Another instance of the OpenSearch Sink module (or a differently configured one) that takes the enriched chunks (with embedding set 2) and indexes them into a separate OpenSearch cluster or a different index within the same cluster.
  * Usefulness for A/B Testing: Having data indexed with different embedding models in separate OpenSearch instances (or indices) allows for A/B testing of search relevance. Queries can be run against both versions, and user engagement or relevance metrics can be compared to determine which embedding strategy yields better search results.

This example demonstrates how Rokkon's architecture supports complex data processing workflows, including fan-in from multiple sources, sequential processing, parallel processing with fan-out (to Embedder and Embedder 2), and fan-out to multiple sinks for purposes like A/B testing. Each component can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

     Unit tests and integration tests aer conflated.  they were all made in isolation.  When running together  a ton of them fail.
     5. Absolute Must-Test Areas: Beyond pipeline orchestration, module registration, data flow, and dynamic configuration, what other critical areas must be thoroughly tested?

     * at this point, I want to be able to run rokkon-engine in quarkus dev mode and write code fast.  I want to tests to run fast when I'm in dev mode and then the longer more complex ones belong in the integration test

✦ Okay, this is excellent information and gives us a clear direction. The core issues are common in complex, distributed systems, especially when external dependencies like Consul are heavily utilized.

Here's a proposed testing strategy designed to address your concerns, provide fast feedback during development, and ensure comprehensive coverage for your application's critical functions.

Proposed Testing Strategy for Rokkon Engine


The strategy will focus on clearly defining and separating test types, emphasizing isolation, and leveraging tools to manage external dependencies.

I. Test Type Definitions & Goals

We will categorize tests into four distinct types, each with specific goals and execution characteristics:


1. Unit Tests (Fastest, Most Isolated)
  * Goal: Verify the correctness of individual classes or small, cohesive units of code in complete isolation.
  * Scope: Focus on business logic, algorithms, and internal state.
  * Dependencies: All external dependencies (Consul client, Kafka client, gRPC stubs, database connections, other services) are mocked or stubbed. No network calls or file system access (beyond test resources).
  * Execution: Extremely fast, run frequently during development (e.g., on every save or commit).
  * Location: src/test/java (or src/test/kotlin)


2. Component/Service Tests (Fast, Isolated from External Systems)
  * Goal: Verify the behavior of a single service or a small group of interacting components (e.g., ModuleRegistrationService, PipelineManager).
  * Scope: Test the integration within a logical component, but still isolate from external systems.
  * Dependencies: External systems like Consul, Kafka, or other modules are mocked or stubbed at their API boundaries. For example, you might mock the ConsulClient interface, but test the logic that uses that client.
  * Execution: Fast, suitable for running during the quarkusDev cycle.
  * Location: src/test/java (or src/test/kotlin) – these can live alongside unit tests but should be clearly distinguishable (e.g., by naming conventions or dedicated test classes).


3. Integration Tests (Slower, Real External Dependencies)
  * Goal: Verify interactions between multiple components, including the Rokkon Engine and its real external dependencies (Consul, Kafka).
  * Scope: Test the "glue code" and ensure components work together as expected in a more realistic environment.
  * Dependencies: Use real, ephemeral instances of Consul and Kafka (e.g., via Testcontainers). Other modules might be represented by simple, in-memory gRPC servers that mimic their behavior.
  * Execution: Slower than unit/component tests. Run less frequently, typically before merging to main branches or as part of CI/CD.
  * Location: src/integrationTest/java (requires a separate Gradle source set configuration).


4. End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Slowest, Most Comprehensive)
  * Goal: Verify the entire system from an external perspective, simulating real user scenarios (e.g., deploying a full pipeline, sending data through a connector, verifying it lands in a sink like OpenSearch).
  * Scope: Cover the full data flow and critical user journeys.
  * Dependencies: All components (Rokkon Engine, real modules, Consul, Kafka, OpenSearch, etc.) are running in a deployed environment (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes).
  * Execution: The slowest. Run only in dedicated test environments or as part of nightly CI/CD builds.
  * Location: A separate project or directory (e.g., integration-test/e2e).

II. Addressing Your Current Issues


1. Conflated Unit/Integration Tests & Flakiness:
  * Solution: Strict adherence to the definitions above. Unit and Component tests must not make network calls or rely on external services. This eliminates a major source of flakiness.
  * Isolation: For Integration and E2E tests, use Testcontainers to spin up fresh, isolated instances of Consul, Kafka, and other services for each test run. This ensures tests don't interfere with each other through shared state in external systems.


2. Slowness:
  * Solution: The clear separation ensures that the tests you run most frequently (Unit, Component) are fast.
  * Optimization: For Integration and E2E tests, optimize setup/teardown (e.g., reuse Testcontainers instances across a test class if safe, but not across the entire test suite).


3. Coverage Gaps:
  * Solution: With easier-to-write and faster-to-run unit/component tests, developers will be more inclined to write them, naturally increasing coverage.
  * Tools: Integrate code coverage tools (e.g., JaCoCo for Java/Kotlin) into your CI/CD pipeline to track and enforce coverage targets.


4. Difficulty in Setup/Writing:
  * Solution:
    * Mocking Frameworks: Use powerful mocking frameworks (Mockito for Java, MockK for Kotlin) to simplify unit/component test setup.
    * Testcontainers: While it adds a dependency, it simplifies the setup of complex integration environments significantly.
    * Templates: Provide clear test templates for new modules and engine components.

III. Specific Strategies for Rokkon's Architecture


1. Testing Consul Interactions (Critical!):
  * Unit/Component Tests: Mock the ConsulClient interface. Focus on the logic that uses Consul (e.g., how the engine processes service registration requests and then calls the Consul client).
  * Integration Tests: Use Testcontainers to spin up a real Consul instance. This allows you to test the actual network communication and data storage/retrieval from Consul.
    * Example: A test could register a mock module with the engine, then query the Testcontainers Consul instance directly to verify the service was registered correctly.


2. Testing Kafka Interactions:
  * Unit/Component Tests: Mock Kafka producers/consumers.
  * Integration Tests: Use Testcontainers for a real Kafka broker (and ZooKeeper if not using KRaft). This allows testing message production, consumption, and offset management.


3. Testing Module Interactions:
  * Engine-side Integration Tests: When testing the Rokkon Engine's orchestration, you don't need to deploy full, complex modules. Instead, create simple, in-memory gRPC servers within your test code that implement the PipeStepProcessor interface. These "mock modules" can return predefined responses or capture requests, allowing you to verify the engine's interaction with them.
  * Module-side Unit/Component Tests: Each module project (modules/chunker, modules/parser, etc.) should have its own comprehensive unit and component tests for its specific logic.
  * Module-side Integration Tests: Modules that interact with external systems (e.g., OpenSearch Sink) should use Testcontainers for those specific external systems.


4. Quarkus Dev Mode & Fast Tests:
  * Configure your build.gradle.kts files to define separate test tasks for test (for Unit/Component tests) and integrationTest (for Integration tests).
  * When running in quarkusDev mode, you should primarily run the fast test task.
  * The integrationTest task would be triggered less frequently, perhaps via a separate Gradle command or in CI.


5. A/B Test Indexing Pipelines (E2E):
  * These tests would involve:
    * Deploying a full Rokkon Engine instance.
    * Deploying multiple real modules (e.g., two different Embedder modules, two OpenSearch Sink modules).
    * Configuring and deploying two distinct pipelines (via the engine's API or CLI) that use these different embedders and sink to different OpenSearch indices.
    * Injecting sample data into the start of the pipelines.
    * Querying the resulting OpenSearch indices to verify data quality, presence of embeddings, and potentially running sample search queries to compare relevance.
    * Testcontainers can be used to spin up ephemeral OpenSearch instances for these E2E tests.


IV. Recommended Tools & Practices

* Build System: Gradle (already in use).
  * Configure separate source sets for integrationTest.
  * Example build.gradle.kts snippet for integrationTest source set:


    1         sourceSets {
    2             main { }
    3             test { }
    4             create("integrationTest") {
    5                 compileClasspath += main.get().output
    6                 runtimeClasspath += main.get().output
    7             }
    8         }
    9 
10         configurations {
11             integrationTestImplementation.extendsFrom(testImplementation)
12             integrationTestRuntimeOnly.extendsFrom(testRuntimeOnly)
13         }
14
15         tasks.register<Test>("integrationTest") {
16             description = "Runs integration tests."
17             group = "verification"
18             testClassesDirs = sourceSets.integrationTest.get().output.classesDirs
19             classpath = sourceSets.integrationTest.get().runtimeClasspath
20             shouldRunAfter(tasks.test)
21         }

* Testing Framework: JUnit 5 (standard for modern Java/Kotlin projects).
* Mocking:
  * Mockito: For Java.
  * MockK: For Kotlin (more idiomatic for Kotlin).
* Containerization for Tests:
  * Testcontainers: Absolutely essential for isolated, reproducible integration tests with real Consul, Kafka, OpenSearch, etc. It manages the lifecycle of Docker containers for your tests.
* Asynchronous Testing:
  * Awaitility: For easily testing asynchronous operations and waiting for conditions to be met (e.g., waiting for a message to appear in Kafka, or a service to register in Consul).
* Code Coverage:
  * JaCoCo: For generating code coverage reports.

Next Steps

I recommend we start by:


1. Setting up the `integrationTest` source set in one of your core `build.gradle.kts` files (e.g., rokkon-engine/build.gradle.kts or the root build.gradle.kts if you want to apply it broadly).
2. Adding Testcontainers as a dependency to that project.
3. Writing a very simple integration test that spins up a Testcontainers Consul instance and attempts to interact with it, just to get the basic setup working.


Would you like me to help you with the Gradle configuration for the integrationTest source set and adding Testcontainers?

> You're absolutely right!  OK - right now my front end mostly works and a LOT of base functionality does, too.  So give me a few momemnts before we start coding.  But it sounds like your strategy - or a strategy to consider - is this: slowly build up the integration and E2E environment.. since I have a working quarkusDev mode, we create working integration tests and slowly start removing the integration tests
from the codebase that are conflated?  At the same time, rewrite the current tests to be unit tests?  I like the slow approach though.  Second question - when I run the engine in quarkus dev mode I get the app.  Should we create a main class in the root that ties eveything together?  We're still in discussion mode...

✦ You've got the strategy exactly right!


Yes, the plan is to:
1. Gradually build up proper integration and E2E tests: We'll start with the most critical interactions (like Consul) and use tools like Testcontainers to ensure these tests are isolated and reliable.
2. Refactor existing tests: As we introduce robust integration tests, we'll identify the "conflated" tests. Those that should be unit tests will be refactored to mock external dependencies, making them fast and truly isolated. The problematic "integration" parts of those tests will either be moved to the new integration test suite or removed if redundant.
3. Phased approach: This slow, deliberate approach minimizes disruption to your current development flow while steadily improving the quality and reliability of your test suite.

Regarding your second question about a "main class in the root that ties everything together" when running in Quarkus dev mode:


* Quarkus Dev Mode (`./gradlew quarkusDev`) is designed to run a single Quarkus application. In your project, the rokkon-engine subproject is the primary Quarkus application that orchestrates everything. When you run quarkusDev from within the rokkon-engine directory (or target it from the root, e.g., ./gradlew :rokkon-engine:quarkusDev), it starts that specific application.
* Tying everything together (engine + modules + Consul + Kafka): This is typically handled by orchestration tools like docker-compose (which you already have in integration-test/docker-compose.dev.yml) or Kubernetes. These tools spin up all the necessary services (Consul, Kafka, the Rokkon Engine, and your various modules) as separate processes or containers, allowing them to communicate over the network.
* No single "main class" for the entire multi-project build: In a multi-project Gradle setup like yours, each subproject (e.g., rokkon-engine, modules/chunker) is its own buildable and runnable unit. There isn't a single Java main class at the root that would magically start all these disparate services.


So, for running the full system during development, your existing docker-compose.dev.yml is the intended way to "tie everything together." For fast iteration on the rokkon-engine itself, quarkusDev is perfect.


Does that clarify things? We can proceed with setting up the integrationTest source set when you're ready.

> so do we require a docker-compose?  Just because I really love the quarkus dev mode

✦ That's a great question, and it highlights a common point of confusion with microservice development!

You're absolutely right to love Quarkus dev mode – it's fantastic for rapid iteration on the rokkon-engine itself.

Here's the distinction:


* `quarkusDev` mode is for running and hot-reloading your Quarkus application's code (in this case, the rokkon-engine). It provides a super-fast feedback loop for changes within the engine's codebase.
* However, the rokkon-engine is designed to interact with external services like Consul and Kafka. These are not part of the rokkon-engine's code; they are separate applications that need to be running somewhere for the engine to function correctly.


So, to make `quarkusDev` mode fully functional for the `rokkon-engine`:

You still need Consul and Kafka to be running and accessible. docker-compose is simply the most convenient and common way to spin up these local dependencies.

Think of it this way:


1. You run docker-compose up -d (the -d means "detached," so it runs in the background). This starts Consul and Kafka.
2. Then, you run ./gradlew :rokkon-engine:quarkusDev. Your rokkon-engine starts up, connects to the already running Consul and Kafka instances, and you get your fast dev mode experience.

You don't need to restart docker-compose every time you make a code change in the engine. You just start it once, and it provides the environment for your quarkusDev session.


In short: `docker-compose` provides the *environment* (Consul, Kafka) that `quarkusDev` (your engine code) needs to interact with.


Does that make sense? We can definitely proceed with setting up the integrationTest source set, which will use Testcontainers to programmatically manage these dependencies for tests, offering a similar "just works" experience within the testing context.

> So here's the problem I ran into though - the engine, consul, and the modules all need to be in the same network.  Consul communicates with both the engine AND modules.  How can we overcome this so we have a consistent environment?

✦ You've hit on a very common and crucial challenge when developing microservices with a mix of host-based development environments (like quarkusDev) and containerized dependencies. You're absolutely right: the engine, Consul, and the modules all need to be able to communicate, and their network locations become critical.

Let's break down the problem and the most practical solutions for a consistent development environment:

The Network Challenge


When you run quarkusDev for rokkon-engine, it's running directly on your host machine (or within your IDE's environment). However, Consul and your modules are running inside Docker containers, which typically reside on a separate, internal Docker network.

This creates two main communication problems:


1. Modules (in Docker) need to register with the Engine (on Host): Modules need to know the IP address or hostname of your host machine so they can send their registration requests to the rokkon-engine.
2. Engine (on Host) needs to communicate with Modules (in Docker): Once modules register, the engine will get their internal Docker container IP addresses from Consul. Your host machine usually cannot directly route to these internal Docker IPs.

Solutions for a Consistent Environment

The goal is to bridge the gap between your host network and the Docker network.

1. Exposing Docker Services to the Host (for Engine -> Consul/Kafka)


This is the easiest part. Your docker-compose.dev.yml already does this by mapping container ports to host ports (e.g., 8500:8500 for Consul, 9092:9092 for Kafka).


* Engine (running `quarkusDev` on host): Can connect to Consul and Kafka using localhost:8500 and localhost:9092 respectively. This is straightforward.

2. Making the Host Accessible from Docker (for Module -> Engine Registration)

Modules need to know how to reach the engine.


* If you're using Docker Desktop (macOS or Windows):
  Docker Desktop provides a special DNS name: host.docker.internal. This resolves to your host machine's IP address from within any Docker container.
  * You would configure your modules (via environment variables in docker-compose.dev.yml) to register with ENGINE_HOST=host.docker.internal.


* If you're on Linux (without Docker Desktop's `host.docker.internal`):
  This is a bit trickier. You'd need to find the IP address of your host machine on the Docker bridge network (e.g., by running ip addr show docker0 and looking for the inet address). You would then pass this specific IP address to your modules as ENGINE_HOST. This IP can change if you restart Docker, so it's less convenient.


3. The Core Challenge: Engine (on Host) -> Module (in Docker) Communication

This is the most complex part for quarkusDev. When a module registers with Consul, it registers its own IP address, which is its internal Docker container IP. Your host machine cannot directly route to these internal Docker IPs.

Practical Approaches for Development:


* A. Map All Module Ports to Host (Less Scalable for Many Modules):
  You could modify your docker-compose.dev.yml to map a unique host port for every module instance's gRPC port (e.g., 9090:9090 for parser-1, 9091:9091 for chunker-1, etc.).
  * Pros: The engine on the host could then theoretically connect to localhost:9090, localhost:9091, etc.
  * Cons:
    * This requires manual port management and becomes unwieldy with many module types or multiple instances of the same module.
    * The engine would need a custom service discovery mechanism to translate the Consul-registered internal Docker IP to the correct localhost:mapped_port. This is non-trivial.


* B. Focus `quarkusDev` on Engine Logic and Registration (Recommended for Fast Iteration):
  For rapid development using quarkusDev, you primarily want to test:
  * The rokkon-engine's core orchestration logic.
  * Its REST API and gRPC control plane.
  * Its ability to receive module registrations (from Dockerized modules using host.docker.internal or host IP).
  * Its interaction with Consul and Kafka.


      For the full data flow (where the engine *sends* data to modules, and modules process it):
      This is where your existing docker-compose.dev.yml (running all services, including the rokkon-engine itself, within Docker) is the ideal environment. In this setup, all components are on the same Docker network, and communication is seamless.


      This means:
       * For engine code changes and API development: Use quarkusDev with Consul/Kafka running via docker-compose. You might run a few key modules in Docker to test registration, but don't expect full data flow testing through them.
       * For full system integration and data flow testing: Use the complete docker-compose.dev.yml setup, where the rokkon-engine is also containerized. This is also the environment where your new integrationTest suite (using Testcontainers) will run.

Summary for Your Workflow


1. Keep `docker-compose.dev.yml` for Consul and Kafka: Run docker-compose up -d consul kafka (or similar) to provide these essential services.
2. Configure `rokkon-engine` (in `quarkusDev`) to use `localhost` for Consul and Kafka.
3. Configure your Dockerized modules to register with the engine using `ENGINE_HOST=host.docker.internal` (Docker Desktop) or your host's Docker bridge IP (Linux).
4. Accept that full engine-to-module data flow testing might be limited in `quarkusDev` mode. For that, you'll rely on the full docker-compose environment or your dedicated integrationTest suite.


This approach gives you the best of both worlds: fast iteration on the engine's core logic with quarkusDev, and a robust, consistent environment for full integration testing when needed.


Does this clarify how we can achieve a consistent environment for your development workflow?

> So mart A - the fundamental problem is that consul does the health checks, so consul would need to call the engine... This is why I was trying to use the docker library with quarkus .. so your point 4 - my thought is to run consul locally, and since the modules do not reach out to consul, we would run the API CLI, consul, and the engine locally.

✦ You've raised a very important point about Consul's role in health checks, and it's crucial we clarify this to ensure a consistent and testable environment.

Let's re-examine how Consul, the Engine, and the Modules interact based on the architecture documents:


1. Module Registration: When a module starts, it uses the rokkon-cli to send a registration request to the Rokkon Engine's `ModuleRegistrationService` (which is a gRPC endpoint on the Engine).
2. Engine's Role in Consul Registration: The Rokkon Engine then performs a RegistrationCheck callback to the module (to verify its health and capabilities). If successful, the Engine (specifically, its engine-consul component) is the sole entity that registers the module as a service in Consul.
3. Consul's Health Checks: Once a module is registered as a service in Consul by the Engine, Consul will then actively perform health checks on that module instance. This means Consul needs to be able to reach the module's IP and port.


So, to be clear:
* Modules *do not* directly register themselves with Consul. They register with the Engine.
* Modules *are* registered in Consul by the Engine.
* Consul *does* health-check the modules.

Re-evaluating Your Proposal ("run consul locally, and since the modules do not reach out to consul...")

If we run Consul locally (on your host machine), and your modules are still running in Docker containers:


* Engine (Host) <-> Consul (Host): This communication would be seamless.
* Modules (Docker) -> Engine (Host): This still works via host.docker.internal (Docker Desktop) or your host's Docker bridge IP (Linux).
* Consul (Host) -> Modules (Docker): This is where the problem arises. If Consul is on your host, it cannot directly reach the internal Docker IP addresses of your modules for health checks. To make this work, you would have to:
  1. Map a unique port from each module container to your host machine (e.g., 9090:9090, 9091:9091, etc.).
  2. Configure Consul (on the host) to health-check localhost:9090, localhost:9091, etc. for each module.


This approach quickly becomes unmanageable and defeats the purpose of dynamic service discovery and scaling, as you'd have to manually manage host port mappings for every module instance.

The Most Consistent Environment for Development


Given the architecture's reliance on Consul for module discovery and health checks, the most consistent and practical development environment is one where all core components (Rokkon Engine, Consul, Kafka, and your Modules) reside within the same network space.

This is precisely what docker-compose provides.

Here's the recommended workflow to leverage `quarkusDev` while maintaining consistency:


1. Full Docker Compose Environment for Integration & E2E Testing:
  * For comprehensive testing of the entire system, including data flow through modules, use your docker-compose.dev.yml where the rokkon-engine itself is also containerized.
  * This ensures all components are on the same Docker network, and Consul can seamlessly health-check modules, and the Engine can communicate with them using their internal Docker IPs.
  * This will be the environment for your new integrationTest suite (using Testcontainers, which will spin up a similar isolated Docker environment).


2. `quarkusDev` for Rapid Engine Logic & API Development:
  * When you're primarily working on the rokkon-engine's core logic, its REST API, or its gRPC control plane, you can run it in quarkusDev mode on your host.
  * You will still need Consul and Kafka running in Docker via `docker-compose` (e.g., docker-compose up -d consul kafka). Your quarkusDev instance of the Engine will connect to them via localhost:8500 and localhost:9092 (due to port mapping).
  * Module Registration: Your Dockerized modules can still register with your host-based quarkusDev engine using ENGINE_HOST=host.docker.internal (if on Docker Desktop) or your host's Docker bridge IP (if on Linux).
  * Limitation: In this quarkusDev setup, the Engine (on host) will not be able to directly send data to modules (in Docker) for processing, because it cannot route to their internal Docker IPs. This means you won't be able to test the full data processing pipeline end-to-end in this specific quarkusDev mode.

In summary:


* For fast iteration on the Engine's internal logic and API: Use quarkusDev with Dockerized Consul/Kafka.
* For testing the full data flow and system integration: Use the complete docker-compose environment where the Engine is also containerized.

This dual approach gives you the best of both worlds: the speed of quarkusDev for focused development and the consistency of Docker Compose for full system validation.


Does this clarification of Consul's health-checking role and the proposed workflow make sense for your development environment?

> one more thing I did not do that may help ALL of this - consul in production will run as a sidecar.  So it will mean that consul will take over the DNS. This would allow me to set consul as "localhost" in my config and consul takes care of that.  I'm not familar with this, but my coworker told me all about it and I have to research this.  He said most "normal" consul deployments will deploy consul client
running inside the container to resolve all the networking woes...  Is that correct?  Sounds like I need to get a base image with consul and jdk21 on it...

✦ Yes, your coworker is absolutely correct! Running a Consul agent (often referred to as a "client" in Consul terminology) as a sidecar alongside your application container is a very common and highly recommended pattern for Consul deployments, especially in containerized and microservice environments like Kubernetes.

Here's why it's correct and why it resolves many "networking woes":


1. Local Service Discovery:
  * Your application (Rokkon Engine, or any module) can always connect to its local Consul agent via localhost:8500 (for HTTP API) or localhost:8600 (for DNS queries).
  * The local agent then handles forwarding these requests to the central Consul server cluster. This abstracts away the complexity of knowing the central Consul server's IP address, which might change or be behind a load balancer.


2. Accurate Health Checks:
  * The Consul agent running as a sidecar can perform health checks on the local application instance (e.g., by hitting localhost:<app_port>/health). This is the most accurate way to determine if that specific instance of your application is healthy.
  * The sidecar agent then reports this health status to the central Consul servers. This is much more reliable than a remote Consul server trying to health-check an application instance across a network.


3. Simplified Networking:
  * Because applications talk to localhost, you don't have to worry about complex network routing, host.docker.internal hacks, or exposing internal Docker IPs to your host for health checks. All communication with Consul is local to the container's network namespace.
  * When combined with Consul Connect (the service mesh feature), the sidecar can also handle mTLS encryption and traffic routing, further simplifying application-to-application communication.


4. Consistent Configuration:
  * Every application (Engine, Module) can be configured identically to point to localhost for Consul, regardless of its deployment environment (local dev, staging, production).

Regarding "a base image with consul and jdk21 on it..."


While technically possible to create a single Docker image with both, the standard and recommended practice for the sidecar pattern is to use two separate containers within the same Kubernetes Pod (or Docker Compose service) that share the same network namespace.

* Container 1: Your application (e.g., rokkon-engine built with JDK21).
* Container 2: The official consul/consul Docker image running in client mode.


They share localhost, so your application talks to the Consul agent on localhost, and the agent talks to the central Consul servers.

Impact on Our Strategy

This is fantastic news and significantly simplifies the networking aspect of your development and testing environment. It means we can align your local setup much more closely with your production deployment.


Here's how this changes our approach:


1. `docker-compose.dev.yml` will become more complex: Each service (Rokkon Engine, each module) will now be defined with two containers: your application and a Consul agent sidecar.
2. `quarkusDev` workflow will need a local Consul agent: If you want your quarkusDev instance of the Engine to behave exactly like its containerized counterpart (i.e., talking to localhost for Consul), you'll need to run a Consul agent directly on your host machine and configure it to connect to your docker-compose'd central Consul servers.
  * Alternatively, for quarkusDev, you might choose to mock Consul entirely for pure unit/component tests, and rely on the full docker-compose environment (where the Engine is also containerized with its sidecar) for integration testing. This might be simpler initially.
3. Testcontainers setup will mimic sidecars: When we write integration tests using Testcontainers, we'll need to ensure that for any service under test that interacts with Consul, we spin up both the application container and a co-located Testcontainers Consul agent container.


This is a much more robust and scalable approach. It will make your development environment more consistent with production and simplify networking configuration within your applications.


Are you ready to proceed with updating your docker-compose.dev.yml to include Consul sidecars for the Engine and Modules? This would be the foundational step to align your development environment with this production strategy.

> Quick question - what's better a sidecar or creating a base image?  I think our base image would want the CLI build on it anyway.. so we can include our CLI tools and consul.. It would make it harder for 3rd parties to use this software if they want to have their own images though.. we would want to minimize that work too... but wondering what's better?  It sounds like sidecar because it would allow 3rd
parties to more easier customize their builds?

✦ You've hit on a very insightful point, and your intuition is spot on!


The sidecar pattern is generally superior to creating a monolithic base image that includes both your application and the Consul agent.

Here's a breakdown of why, addressing your points:

Sidecar Pattern (Separate Containers in a Shared Pod/Service)


* Separation of Concerns: This is the biggest advantage. Each container has a single, well-defined responsibility. One runs your application (Rokkon Engine or a module), and the other runs the Consul agent.
  * Benefits:
    * Independent Updates: You can update the Consul agent version without rebuilding or redeploying your application image. Similarly, you can update your application without touching the Consul agent.
    * Smaller Images: Each image is smaller, leading to faster pulls, pushes, and builds.
    * Reusability: The official Consul agent Docker image is generic and can be reused across all your applications and by third parties.
    * Resource Management: Easier to allocate CPU and memory resources independently to your application and the Consul agent.
    * Security: A smaller attack surface for each container. If a vulnerability is found in Consul, you update only the Consul sidecar.
    * Standard Practice: This is the widely accepted and recommended pattern for deploying service mesh agents and other infrastructure components alongside applications in containerized environments (e.g., Kubernetes).


* Third-Party Customization: This is precisely where the sidecar shines for external users.
  * Third parties can use their own preferred base images (e.g., a specific flavor of Alpine Linux, a different JDK distribution, a custom security-hardened image) for their modules.
  * They simply need to add the official Consul agent container as a sidecar in their deployment definition (e.g., their docker-compose.yml or Kubernetes manifest). They don't have to inherit from a custom, potentially opinionated, base image you provide. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry and increases flexibility for them.

Monolithic Base Image (App + Consul Agent + CLI Tools)


* Initial Simplicity (Deceptive): It might seem simpler to manage a single image initially.
* Drawbacks:
  * Tight Coupling: Any update to the Consul agent (or even your CLI tools) requires rebuilding and redeploying your entire application image.
  * Larger Images: The image will be larger, containing more software than strictly necessary for the application itself.
  * Reduced Flexibility: Less adaptable to different environments or specific user requirements.
  * Security: A vulnerability in any component (your app, Consul, CLI tools) means the entire image needs to be replaced.

Including CLI Tools (rokkon-cli.jar)


This is a separate consideration from the Consul agent.


* Your rokkon-cli.jar is an application-specific utility. It makes perfect sense to include it directly within your application's main container image (e.g., in the rokkon-engine image, or in your module images if they need to use it for registration).
* You could even create a custom base image for your own internal modules that includes the JDK and rokkon-cli.jar if all your modules consistently need it. This would be an internal optimization.
* However, for third parties, they would likely prefer to either:
  * Download and run rokkon-cli.jar separately if they are managing their own module deployments.
  * Or, if they are building their own modules, they would include the rokkon-cli.jar in their module's image as part of their build process, similar to how you do it.

Conclusion

Your intuition is correct. The sidecar pattern for the Consul agent is the superior choice for flexibility, maintainability, and especially for enabling third-party adoption and customization. It aligns with modern containerization best practices.


Including your rokkon-cli.jar within your application's main container (or a custom base image for your own internal modules) is a reasonable approach for application-specific utilities.


This means our docker-compose.dev.yml will evolve to reflect this sidecar pattern, which will provide a much more consistent and robust development and testing environment.

> So we would be coding against the following environments - which is great because we DO have a complex setup but would be amazingly flexible and quick to test when we get here -- 1) Unit tests (Everything is mocked) 2) Component testing (Less mocked, external systems are mocked) (#1 and #2 will be part of the quarkus dev mode) 3) Quarkus dev mode - I live update the front end and code as I update 1 and 2...
4) Integration testing - true tests for each component where all necessary things are started and we are cool to real-life test... 5) E2E testing - robust simulation and can lead to things like performance testing and full automation of tests... (we left out stress and performance testing for now)

✦ That's an absolutely perfect summary! You've captured the essence of the strategy and how each layer contributes to a robust, flexible, and efficient testing workflow for your complex application.

To reiterate:


1. Unit Tests: Isolated, fast, for individual code units.
2. Component Tests: Isolated, fast, for internal service logic, with external systems mocked.
  * (1 & 2 are your "fast tests" for `quarkusDev` mode.)
3. Quarkus Dev Mode: Your primary development environment for rapid iteration, leveraging the speed of unit/component tests and hot-reloading.
4. Integration Tests: True integration with real, ephemeral external dependencies (Consul, Kafka, etc., managed by Testcontainers), ensuring components work together.
5. E2E Tests: Full system validation, simulating real user scenarios in a deployed environment, paving the way for future performance and stress testing.

This layered approach will provide you with fast feedback during development while ensuring comprehensive coverage and confidence in your system's behavior in more realistic environments.


Now that we have a clear understanding and agreement on the strategy, we can start implementing it. The first step will be to set up the integrationTest source set in your Gradle build and introduce Testcontainers.
