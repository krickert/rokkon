# Quarkus Dev Mode Implementation Status

## Current Status: Testing Phase

### What We're Keeping from Previous Work:
1. **Docker client dependency** - Already added to build.gradle.kts
2. **Dev ports in application-dev.yml** - 39001 (HTTP) and 49001 (gRPC)
3. **Package structure** - `com.rokkon.pipeline.engine.dev` exists
4. **Compose configuration** - Already in application.properties

### What We've Done:
1. [x] Created docker-compose-dev-service.yml with proper naming
2. [x] Removed profiles that were preventing startup
3. [x] Ensured no conflicts with production containers (using -dev suffix)
4. [x] Fixed application.properties (set dev consul port to 8501)
5. [x] Updated seeder to seed to engine sidecar (not main consul)
6. [x] Manual test confirms all containers start correctly
7. [x] Documented ports and access points

### What We Need to Do:
1. [ ] Test that Quarkus auto-detects and starts compose
2. [x] Verify engine connects to consul sidecar (port 8501)
3. [ ] Verify modules register properly (waiting for engine to fully start)
4. [ ] Document any remaining issues

### Current Issues:
- Quarkus compose dev services doesn't seem to auto-start our compose file
- Need to investigate if additional configuration is needed
- Engine takes time to build and start (normal for first run)

### Discovered Issues:
- Quarkus compose dev services might not be included in our dependencies
- Need to verify if we need additional extensions
- Docker images still use "rokkon" prefix (working with existing images for now)

### Decision: Work with What We Have
- Using existing `rokkon/echo-module:latest` and `rokkon/test-module:latest` images
- Will rename to "pipeline" in a future phase
- Focus on getting dev environment working first

### What We're Removing/Ignoring (For Now):
- Custom Docker management Java code
- Complex implementation phases
- Dynamic module start/stop

## Test Commands:

```bash
# Check what's running
docker ps | grep dev

# Check consul
curl http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/services

# Check engine health
curl http://localhost:39001/q/health

# Clean everything
docker compose -p pipeline-dev down -v
```

## Notes:
- Starting fresh with minimal approach
- Leveraging Quarkus built-in capabilities
- Will add complexity only as needed
