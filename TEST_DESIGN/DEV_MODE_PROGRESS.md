# Dev Mode Progress Summary

## Current State

### What's Working
1. **Manual Compose Startup**: Running `docker compose -f compose-devservices.yml up -d` successfully starts all infrastructure
2. **Consul Configuration**: Seeding works correctly with configuration available at both ports 8500 and 8501
3. **Engine Connection**: After manual startup, running `./gradlew :engine:pipestream:quarkusDev` connects successfully to Consul at port 8501
4. **Module Timing**: Added 30-second delays to modules to ensure engine is ready before they attempt registration

### What's Not Working
1. **Automatic Compose Detection**: Quarkus isn't automatically detecting and starting the `compose-devservices.yml` file
2. **Profile Loading**: The dev profile settings aren't being applied during the initial build phase when Consul config is loaded

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is a chicken-and-egg problem:
- Quarkus tries to connect to Consul during the build/configuration phase
- This happens BEFORE compose dev services can start
- The dev profile settings (port 8501) aren't loaded because Consul isn't available yet

## Attempted Solutions

1. ✅ Renamed file to `compose-devservices.yml` to match Quarkus pattern
2. ✅ Configured compose dev services in application.properties
3. ✅ Set up proper Consul seeding in compose file
4. ❌ Quarkus compose auto-detection still not working

## Next Steps for Future Sessions

### Option 1: Custom Dev Service Implementation
Create a custom Quarkus extension that:
- Extends the compose dev services functionality
- Ensures Consul is started and seeded BEFORE configuration loading
- Manages the proper startup sequence

### Option 2: Lazy Consul Configuration
Modify the Consul configuration approach to:
- Skip Consul during build time
- Load configuration lazily at runtime
- Use default values during build

### Option 3: Build-time vs Runtime Configuration Split
- Move critical configuration to application.properties
- Use Consul only for runtime-specific values
- This would allow the build to complete without Consul

### Option 4: Two-Phase Startup Script
Create a wrapper script that:
1. Starts compose services
2. Waits for Consul to be ready
3. Then runs quarkusDev

## Current Workaround

For now, developers can use:
```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker compose -f compose-devservices.yml up -d

# Wait for services to be ready
sleep 10

# Run Quarkus dev mode
export QUARKUS_PROFILE=dev
./gradlew :engine:pipestream:quarkusDev
```

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/compose-devservices.yml` - Main compose file for dev services
2. `/engine/pipestream/src/main/resources/application.properties` - Updated with dev profile settings
3. `/engine/pipestream/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml` - Dev profile configuration
4. This progress document

## Key Learnings

1. Quarkus compose dev services are part of the core, not a separate extension
2. The compose file pattern matching works, but timing is critical
3. Consul config loading happens very early in the Quarkus lifecycle
4. The sidecar pattern adds complexity but maintains consistency with production
