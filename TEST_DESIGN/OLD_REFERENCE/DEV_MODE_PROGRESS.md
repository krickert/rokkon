# Dev Mode Implementation Progress

## Current Phase: Phase 2 - Basic Infrastructure Start/Stop
## Completed Phases: Phase 0 ✅, Phase 1 ✅
## Total Phases: 8 (including Phase 0)

## Next Steps:
1. Research leveraging Quarkus ComposeDevServicesProcessor
2. Update design to use existing Docker Compose support
3. Start Phase 2 with Quarkus-native approach

## Implementation Checklist:

### Phase 0: Prerequisites & Foundation ✅
- [x] Add Quarkiverse Docker Client dependency to engine build.gradle (version 0.0.4)
- [x] Check port availability (39001, 49001, 8501, 8502) - all available
- [x] Backup existing application-dev.yml and create new one
- [x] Create initial dev mode package structure
- [x] Verify module images are available in local registry
- [x] Create PipelineModule enum
- [x] Create DockerAvailabilityChecker with @IfBuildProfile("dev")
- [x] Verify build with new dependency - BUILD SUCCESSFUL
- [x] Document integration approach (dev mode isolated with different ports/project name)

### Phase 1: Foundation - Docker Client & Host IP Detection ✅
- [x] Docker Client already added in Phase 0
- [x] PipelineModule enum already created in Phase 0
- [x] Implement host IP detection logic with fallbacks
- [x] Create basic `PipelineDevModeInfrastructure` class
- [x] Basic tests passing (HostIPDetectorSimpleTest)

**Key Discovery**: Quarkus already has full Docker Compose support via `ComposeDevServicesProcessor`! 
We should leverage this instead of building custom compose management.

### Phase 2: Basic Infrastructure Start/Stop
- [ ] Create enhanced docker-compose.dev.yml with engine sidecar
- [ ] Implement `startDevInfrastructure()` for core services only
- [ ] Add infrastructure health checks
- [ ] Implement `isInfrastructureRunning()` detection
- [ ] Test manual infrastructure lifecycle

### Phase 3: Module Management Core
- [ ] Implement Docker-Java based container management
- [ ] Add `startContainer()` and `stopContainer()` methods
- [ ] Implement `executeDockerComposeViaAPI()` for missing containers
- [ ] Add module health checking logic
- [ ] Test with echo module only

### Phase 4: REST API & Dev Endpoints
- [ ] Create `DevModuleResource` with basic endpoints
- [ ] Implement `/q/dev/pipeline/modules` listing
- [ ] Add start/stop endpoints
- [ ] Add module status reporting
- [ ] Test via curl commands

### Phase 5: Auto-start Integration
- [ ] Implement `@Observes StartupEvent` handler
- [ ] Add configuration properties for dev mode
- [ ] Implement default module startup
- [ ] Add graceful error handling
- [ ] Test full auto-start flow

### Phase 6: Dev UI Integration
- [ ] Create Quarkus Dev UI extension
- [ ] Add module status card
- [ ] Implement start/stop buttons
- [ ] Add infrastructure health display
- [ ] Test UI interactions

### Phase 7: Pipeline Testing Integration
- [ ] Add sample pipeline creation endpoints
- [ ] Create pipeline test data generators
- [ ] Add pipeline execution helpers
- [ ] Document pipeline testing workflow
- [ ] Create example test scenarios

## Recent Changes:
- 2025-01-03: Created implementation plan and progress tracking
- 2025-01-03: Completed Phase 0 - Added Docker client dependency (0.0.4), created dev package structure, updated application-dev.yml with new ports (39001/49001)
- 2025-01-03: Completed Phase 1 - Implemented HostIPDetector, PipelineDevModeInfrastructure, basic tests passing
- 2025-01-03: Discovered Quarkus has built-in Docker Compose support - pivoting approach

## Known Issues:
- None yet

## Key Discoveries from Reference Code:
1. **Quarkus Docker Compose Support** (`ComposeDevServicesProcessor`)
   - Full Docker Compose lifecycle management
   - Automatic container cleanup and reuse
   - Label-based tracking
   - Located in: `/extensions/devservices/deployment/`

2. **Dev UI Infrastructure** 
   - JsonRPC providers for real-time data
   - WebSocket support built-in
   - Located in: `/extensions/vertx-http/dev-console/`

3. **Health Check Patterns**
   - SmallRye Health with async support
   - Dynamic health check registration
   - Located in: `/smallrye-health/`

4. **Container Management Tools**
   - `ContainerLocator` for finding existing containers
   - Label-based tracking patterns
   - Located in: `/extensions/devservices/`

## Current Implementation Status:
- **Design Document**: Consolidated into single DEV_MODE_DESIGN.md
- **Docker Compose**: Created docker-compose-dev-service.yml following Quarkus conventions
- **Configuration**: Updated application.properties with compose settings
- **Next Target**: Test dev mode with automatic compose startup

## Test Commands:
```bash
# Will be updated as implementation progresses
```

## Git Tags:
- Phase checkpoints will be tagged as: `dev-mode-phase-X`

## Recovery Commands:
```bash
# If you lose context, run:
cat DEV_MODE_PROGRESS.md
git log --oneline --grep="dev-mode" -10
docker ps | grep pipeline-dev
```
