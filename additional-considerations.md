# Additional Considerations for Updating Network_topology.md and Pipeline_design.md

## General Approach

When updating these files, it's important to take a methodical approach to ensure all occurrences are properly replaced without breaking the functionality of diagrams and code examples.

## Interactive Guidance Recommendations

When guiding someone through these updates interactively:

1. **Start with Regular Text**: Begin with the simpler text replacements before tackling the more complex mermaid diagrams.

2. **One Diagram at a Time**: Work through each mermaid diagram separately, making all changes to one diagram before moving to the next.

3. **Validate Diagram Syntax**: After updating each mermaid diagram, validate the syntax to ensure it still renders correctly. Many markdown editors and tools like Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/) can be used for this.

4. **Preserve Code Functionality**: When updating code examples, ensure that only necessary changes are made. Package names (com.rokkon.*) should remain unchanged as noted in the task lists.

5. **Incremental Testing**: If possible, render the markdown after each significant change to verify that diagrams and formatting remain intact.

## Potential Challenges

1. **Mermaid Diagram Complexity**: The mermaid diagrams in these files are complex with many interconnected elements. Changes must be made carefully to maintain the relationships between nodes.

2. **Consistent Naming**: Ensure consistency in naming conventions throughout the documents. For example, if changing `RokkonEngine` to `PipelineEngine`, make sure all references to this component are updated.

3. **Hidden Occurrences**: Some occurrences of "Rokkon" might be in comments or less obvious places within code blocks. A thorough review is necessary.

4. **Line Number Shifts**: As changes are made, line numbers may shift. If working through the task list sequentially, be aware that line numbers in later tasks may no longer be accurate.

## Final Verification

After completing all tasks:

1. **Full Document Review**: Read through the entire document to catch any missed occurrences.

2. **Search Verification**: Perform a final search for "Rokkon" to ensure no instances were missed.

3. **Diagram Rendering**: Verify that all mermaid diagrams render correctly.

4. **Consistency Check**: Ensure terminology is consistent throughout the document and with other related documentation.
